> **"The future of DeFi is not automated, it is *alive*."**

**OMNI-CORE** is a next-generation decentralized application (dApp) that bridges the gap between **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** and **Blockchain**. It serves as a visual and functional neural interface for the **Cortensor Network**, allowing users to interact with a swarm of specialized AI agents that optimize yields, audit smart contracts, and predict market variances in real-time.

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. 🧠 The Consciousness Stream (Powered by Groq)
Most AI interfaces are static. OMNI-CORE is **"aware."**
-   **Real-time Thought Process**: Witness the AI's internal monologue as it scans the blockchain, analyzing gas prices, checking node health, and monitoring liquidity pools — autonomously.
-   **LPU Accelerated**: Using Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit) with **Llama 3.3 70B**, inference happens in milliseconds, ensuring valid real-time analysis.
-   **Structured AI Output**: Commands are analyzed and classified into structured JSON (`taskType`, `priority`), enabling intelligent task routing — not just chat responses.

### 2. 🕸️ The Delegation Matrix (Cortensor Integration)
OMNI-CORE does not centralize power. It **distributes** it.
-   **Interactive 3D Node Visualization**: An immersive React Three Fiber canvas showing all active Cortensor nodes (Workers, Validators, Groq Core) with real-time status.
-   **Smart Node Selection**: When a user issues a command (e.g., "Audit contract"), the AI classifies the task and routes it to the **best specialist node** (Security → Node #42, Yield → Node #18, Audit → Node #73).
-   **Energy Beam Animation**: A glowing, animated beam shoots from the Groq Core to the target node during task delegation — making the process visually tangible.
-   **Proof of Inference (PoI)**: Each delegated task generates a cryptographic hash, simulating Cortensor's decentralized verification mechanism.

### 3. ✨ Premium "Void-Glass" Aesthetics
Designed to feel like a **sci-fi command center**.
-   **Glassmorphism UI**: Deep, layered transparency with subtle backdrop blur effects.
-   **Neon Typography**: High-contrast legibility for data-heavy dashboards using Inter and JetBrains Mono.
-   **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience from desktop monitors to mobile devices.
-   **Micro-Animations**: Framer Motion powers smooth transitions, hover effects, and status changes.

## 🎮 How to Use

1.  **Open the app** — The AI consciousness stream will begin thinking autonomously.
2.  **Type a command** in the terminal input at the bottom-left:
    -   `"Scan contract 0xABC for vulnerabilities"` → Routes to **Security Node #42**
    -   `"Calculate best yield for BNB staking"` → Routes to **Yield Node #18**
    -   `"Audit transaction history for wallet 0x123"` → Routes to **Audit Node #73**
3.  **Watch the flow**:
    -   AI analyzes your command → Classifies task type → Selects optimal node
    -   ⚡ **Energy Beam** shoots from Groq Core to the target node in 3D
    -   Task appears in queue → Proof of Inference hash is generated → Verified ✅
4.  **Interact with the 3D graph**: Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, explore the network.

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

**Event**: Cortensor Hackathon #4 (DoraHacks)  
**Category**: AI × Blockchain Integration  
**Built by**: Pandu Dargah  

### Why OMNI-CORE Stands Out:
1.  **Real AI Integration** — Not a mock UI. Groq API processes every command in real-time with structured JSON output.
2.  **Intelligent Routing** — AI doesn't just respond; it classifies tasks and routes them to specialized network nodes.
3.  **Visual Proof** — The 3D energy beam and PoI hash make the decentralized verification process *tangible* and *impressive*.
4.  **Production Quality** — Responsive, polished, deployed, and ready for real-world use.
